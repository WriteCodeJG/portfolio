 <h1>About Me</h1>
     <p>I am a technical writer, editor, and content developer with a lot of experience planning, developing, writing, organizing, and editing technical content across many different domains. I am a detail-oriented self-starter who thrives in dynamic environments that encourage independent motivation within a collaborative framework. My passions are learning, problem-solving, and doing what I can to help users achieve their goals.</p>     
    <p>While some writers are content to remain at the surface, I dive deep to learn all I can. This enables me to prioritize information and communicate to users accurately and from a place of understanding. It also makes me a good trainer and problem solver.</p> 
    <p>I am recognized for my collaboration and mentoring skills and for my ability to handle multiple simultaneous projects and complex tech scenarios.</p>

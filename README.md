I am a technical writer based in Austin, Texas, with experience creating documentation for leading technology companies, including IBM Global Services, Tivoli Software, Reddwerks, AMD, TippingPoint, and National Instruments. In addition to corporate technology, I've documented statewide financial systems at the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts and a payment processing system for the Texas Office of the Attorney General. 

My work spans a number of technical domains, from fiscal management systems and IT service management tools to supply chain management platforms, semiconductor technology, network security, and test and measurement systems.

 | API Documentation | As lead technical writer for National Instruments’ automotive test hardware and driver software, I edited, updated, and maintained LabVIEW and C API reference content for NI-XNET, Automotive Diagnostic Command Set, and ECU Measurement & Calibration software. These are customer-facing APIs designed for NI customers who integrate XNET-compatible interfaces into their own systems and applications.<br><br>This [sample](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/bahwgbmo3q77aag0pklrg/xnet-api-sample.pdf?rlkey=ds11s1i8s8tw7qn44zi446ln2&st=bq0662jy&dl=0) is from the NI-XNET API for C programming language. The "Getting Started" topic provides information required to use Automotive Ethernet Socket API for C. The "nxIpStackCreate" topic describes a single function that enables the customer to programmatically create an IP stack independent from the limitations of the operating system’s native IP stack. Ultimately, this enables customers to use multiple XNET interfaces with the same static IP address, making ECU testing more flexible and productive.<br><br>The NI-XNET API reference was created in HTML and delivered in compiled HTML Help format. |  [Excerpt: XNET API for C](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/bahwgbmo3q77aag0pklrg/xnet-api-sample.pdf?rlkey=ds11s1i8s8tw7qn44zi446ln2&st=bq0662jy&dl=0) |
 | User Documentation | This [excerpt](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7jdcqnbm2yisujh3nyo45/task-config-install-login.pdf?rlkey=tkvmh2xqd8sfujg9j8o3izqyl&st=0nv4kz8w&dl=0) from the _HP TippingPoint vSMS Getting Started Guide v4.1_ provides instructions for configuring the virtual client to log into the HP TippingPoint Security Management System (SMS). As an information developer at HP TippingPoint, I developed documentation to support network security professionals integrating these solutions into their environments. I created documentation for software and hardware, including intrusion prevention system (IPS) devices and the platform’s first next-generation firewall system. I authored content in FrameMaker, used Illustrator and Visio for images and diagrams, and published documents in PDF format for enterprise distribution. | [Excerpt: vSMS GSG](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7jdcqnbm2yisujh3nyo45/task-config-install-login.pdf?rlkey=tkvmh2xqd8sfujg9j8o3izqyl&st=0nv4kz8w&dl=0) |
 | Hardware Documentation | This 12-page document is the [user manual](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/z8sapt5h4yxzvqdb1vlie/pixe-8521_um.pdf?rlkey=dygjyz9tlmp68346mrbh7kec0&st=u4zef8u2&dl=0) for the PXIe-8521 4-port, 100BASE-T1 PXI Automotive Ethernet Interface Module, NI’s first Automotive Ethernet PXI Express module. The manual covers installation, configuration, and basic operation, guiding the user from unpacking the kit through connecting and preparing the device for use. I authored the manual using Oxygen Author to develop structured DITA content and Adobe Illustrator to create SVG illustrations. I delivered a PDF and print specifications to the print shop for printed copies to be included in the hardware kits, and I prepared the PDF for publication on the NI website, integrating appropriate product codes and metadata. | [PXIe-8521 User Manual](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/z8sapt5h4yxzvqdb1vlie/pixe-8521_um.pdf?rlkey=dygjyz9tlmp68346mrbh7kec0&st=u4zef8u2&dl=0) |
